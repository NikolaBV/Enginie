# 2D Engine

## Quick Start

All required DLLs for SDL2 and its extensions are included in the `dlls/` directory. When you build the project, the DLLs will be automatically copied to the output directory. No extra setup is needed after cloningâ€”just open the solution, build, and run!

If you add new dependencies, place their DLLs in `dlls/` and commit them.
