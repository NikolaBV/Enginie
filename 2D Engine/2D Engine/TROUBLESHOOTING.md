# Troubleshooting Guide

## Project Status: ✅ READY TO CLONE AND RUN

This project is now configured for **zero-setup deployment**. After cloning, you can run it immediately using either method below.

## Quick Start (No Setup Required)

### Option 1: Batch File (Recommended)
```bash
run_game.bat
```
This automatically handles everything - no manual setup needed.

### Option 2: Visual Studio Build
1. Open `2D Engine.sln`
2. Build the project (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Run the executable

## Previous Issues (Now Fixed)

### Issue: "Error loading texture" messages
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause**: Missing `zlib1.dll` dependency for PNG loading
- `libpng16-16.dll` requires `zlib1.dll` for compression/decompression
- This DLL was missing from the dependency chain

**Solution Applied**:
- Added `zlib1.dll` to the `dlls/` directory
- Updated post-build events to copy this DLL automatically
- Updated batch file to include this dependency

### Issue: Resource files not found
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause**: Relative paths not working from build output directory

**Solution Applied**:
- Post-build events automatically copy all resources
- Batch file handles resource copying
- Better error messages for debugging

## Current Configuration

### Automatic Setup
The project now includes:
- ✅ All required DLLs in `dlls/` directory
- ✅ Post-build events for automatic file copying
- ✅ Batch file for one-click setup and run
- ✅ Comprehensive error messages
- ✅ Complete documentation

### File Structure
```
2D Engine/
├── dlls/                    # All required DLLs (including zlib1.dll)
├── resources/               # All game assets
├── run_game.bat            # One-click setup and run
├── 2D Engine.vcxproj       # Auto-configured build settings
└── README.md               # Complete setup instructions
```

## Expected Behavior

After cloning and running, you should see:
```
SDL is initialized
Window is created
Renderer is created
X: 500; Y: 500
X: 500; Y: 500
...
```

And a window with a scrolling sprite and tile map.

## If You Still Have Issues

1. **Check Visual Studio**: Ensure C++ development tools are installed
2. **Check Windows**: Ensure you're on Windows 10/11
3. **Check Architecture**: Project is configured for x64 (64-bit)
4. **Check Dependencies**: All DLLs should be in `dlls/` directory

The project is now **production-ready** for cloning and immediate use.
